summary: "Resolved scroll-to-top behavior for notes and tasks, added token-based auto-login, and fixed calendar highlighting for today."
---

Bugs Fixed:

- Fixed scroll-to-top behavior when creating a new note to ensure the new item is visible immediately

- Fixed scroll-to-top logic on the main **Notes** page for consistent navigation after interactions

- Corrected a bug where **today&apos;s calendar cell** was not highlighted due to a missing date check

Improvements:

- Implemented **token-based auto-login** using `js-cookie` on the login page

- Users with a valid token are now **automatically redirected** to the calendar without needing to log in again
