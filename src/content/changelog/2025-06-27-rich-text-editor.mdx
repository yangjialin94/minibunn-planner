---

New Features:

- **Rich Text Editor Integration:** All content creation areas for Journals, Notes, and Tasks now feature a powerful rich text editor. This allows for enhanced formatting, including **bold**, _italic_, <u>underline</u>, and text color, accessible via a clean, floating toolbar that appears on text selection.

Improvements:

- **Contextual Actions for Tasks & Notes:** The user interface for interacting with tasks and notes has been streamlined. Action buttons (e.g., Delete) are now hidden by default and appear contextually, creating a cleaner and more focused workspace.

- **Enhanced Desktop Experience:** On desktop, action buttons seamlessly appear when you hover over an item, making management quick and intuitive.

- **Optimized Mobile Interaction:** For a better mobile experience, action buttons become visible when you tap on an item to edit, providing easy access without relying on hover states.
