Updated how dates are displayed to make them more user-friendly:

- **Dates** now include the weekday for better context.  
  Example: `"Mar 28, 2025 (Fri)"` instead of `"Mar 28, 2025"`

- **Timestamps** now start with the weekday for quicker orientation.  
  Example: `"Fri, Mar 28, 2025, 6:38 PM"`

These changes help you scan and understand your schedule more easily at a glance.
