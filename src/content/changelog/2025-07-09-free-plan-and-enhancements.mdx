New Features:

- **Introducing the Free Plan:** We're excited to offer a new Free Plan designed for users who primarily need task tracking functionality. This plan allows you to manage your tasks efficiently without any cost.

Bugs Fixed:

- **Resolved Local CORS Issue:** We've fixed a local Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) issue, which improves connectivity and data flow within the application's development and local environments.

- **Streamlined User Onboarding:** The trial period has been removed, simplifying the user onboarding process.

Improvements:

- **Streamlined Pricing Options:** After careful consideration, we've decided to discontinue the Lifetime Plan to simplify our pricing structure. Existing Lifetime Plan subscribers will continue to have access to all their current features.

- **Enhanced Authentication Experience:** We've updated our authentication error messages to be clearer and more helpful, making it easier for you to understand and resolve any login issues.

- **Codebase Optimization:** We've removed several unused dependencies, old components, and unnecessary files. This helps us keep our application leaner, more efficient, and easier to maintain.

- **Database Performance:** We've replaced the database update code with a SQLAlchemy-compatible solution, ensuring more robust, efficient, and maintainable interactions with your data.

- **Enhanced Test Coverage:** We've added more tests across the codebase, significantly increasing our test coverage. This leads to a more stable and reliable application.
